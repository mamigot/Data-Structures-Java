Object-Oriented Data Structures
===============================
 
 NYU Fall 2013
 
I am taking Object-Oriented Data Structures this fall and I have created this repo
to post some of my most interesting assignments (coded in Java).

Each directory contains each data structure's underlying files as well as a
sub-directory named "testing", containing the cases we must design to
ensure the validity of our structures.

Index:

1. assign2_stacksQueues: 
        a. Linked-list implementation of a stack and a queue. Nodes are created in separate classes, respectively titled
        "StackListNode.java" and "QueueListNode.java".
        b. "BalanceCheck.java" uses the stack to ensure that provided strings are "balanced" (meaning that for every              opening character stored in the hash-table within the file there is a closing character).
